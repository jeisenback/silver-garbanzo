# Silver Garbanzo (Personal Finance Ingest & Reporting)

Local CLI tool to ingest bank transaction CSV exports, validate strict filename date ranges, categorize deterministically, and report spend/income by period and category.

## Purpose
- Prevent silent ingestion mistakes (bad ranges, overlaps, schema drift)
- Enable fast category iteration via editable rules and overrides
- Produce trustworthy summaries for personal finance review

## Scope
- Single-user
- Local-only execution
- Correctness-first: fail fast on unsafe inputs, warn on recoverable issues

## Data safety
Real financial data is never committed to this repository.
- Put real exports in `data/raw/` (gitignored)
- Use `data/sample/` for synthetic/redacted fixtures (committed later)
- Local ingest state lives in `state/` (gitignored)

See [docs/data-layout.md](docs/data-layout.md) for detailed conventions.

## Status

### Phase A — Foundation (✅ COMPLETE)
- [x] Repository skeleton & branch strategy
- [x] Python runtime & dependencies pinned
- [x] CI workflow (placeholder lint/test)
- [x] ADR framework & documentation discipline
- [x] Data layout & safety conventions

### Phase B — Ingest Contract (🔄 IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Parse date range from filename
- [x] Validate CSV header schema (Date, Description, Amount, Transaction_Type)
<<<<<<< HEAD
	- [x] Enforce filename-to-CSV date contract
- [ ] Track & prevent overlaps
- [ ] Atomic registry updates

### Phase C — Safety & Testing (⏳ PLANNED)
- [ ] Dry-run mode
- [ ] Profile mode
- [ ] Sample datasets & CI fixtures
- [ ] Config validation

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run lint
poetry run ruff check .

# Run tests
poetry run pytest -q
```
